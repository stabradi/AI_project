	We propose to generate an improved TCP congestion control mechanism using a genetic algorithm similar to the approach outlined by Winstein and Balakrishnan, with the special requirement that the algorithm must perform well at low adoption rates for both adopters and non-adopters. We will define good performance by testing the mechanism on a simulated network, and measuring each end host's utility based on latency, throughput, and reliability; a good mechanism will score better on average at all or almost all adoption rates among both adopters and non-adopters.
	\subsection{Simulation Network}
		Any structured machine learning algorithm needs to be able to evaluate 
		the performance of an action, and to evaluate performance an agent 
		needs data. We propose to create a program that will simulate a wide-
		area network (WAN) with properties that resemble the Internet. The 
		program will use a directed graph to represent the simulation network,
		with nodes representing hosts and edges representing links. Some nodes
		will be end hosts which try to open TCP connections with one another 
		and transmit data, and other nodes will be routers which try to 
		faithfully carry the packets. All four types of network delay 
		(propagation delay, processing delay, transmission delay, and queuing 
		delay) will be represented, and both links and routers will introduce
		noise and corrupt packets. Where possible, the network topology and 
		delay/reliability properties will be as similar as possible to the 
		Internet. The simulation network will monitor and record network 
		performance data for later analysis.
	\subsection{Congestion Control Neural Net and Genetic Algorithm}
		In their paper, Winstein and Balakrishnan used a genetic algorithm to inform a neural network that affected the TCP congestion control properties, Their reasoning, as they say, was that "the best way to approach this question is to take the design of specific algorithmic mechanisms out of the hands of human designers (no mater how sophisticated!), and make the end-to-end algorithm be a function of the desired overall behavior." We agree with their reasoning, and commend their eloquence.
			    
\section{Proposed Experiments}
	For each generation, we will measure the performance of each candidate algorithm in the simulated network at several different adoption rates. The total utility of the simulation will be a function of the total utility of each user, which is itself a function of that user's throughput, latency, and reliability characteristics. The fitness function our genetic algorithm uses will be based on total simulation utility at each adoption rate, with low adoption rates weighted more.
	\subsection{Expected Results}
		We are hesitant to speculate as to what congestion control algorithms will perform best, but as Winstein and Balakrishnan found, we expect to find significant room for improvement over current TCP standards, even at low adoption rates.
