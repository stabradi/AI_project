\section*{Abstract}
	Recent research has used AI to identify alternative congestion control
        mechanisms for TCP that resulted in significant performance increase;
        however, the mechanisms in question were only tested at one hundred percent
        adoption, leaving a nigh-insurmountable barrier of entry. Our research runs along
        similar lines, but seeks to find alternative mechanisms
        that improve performance on networks that do not have full
	adoption without adversely affecting those who do not adopt. We expect to find
	some alternative mechanisms that achieve better performance than the current
	TCP congestion control mechanism at many or all adoption rates.
\section{Background and Introduction}
        Many aspects of TCP's existing congestion control mechanism appear to have
        been selected out of convenience rather than carefully chosen to maximize performance.
        For instance, when in the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease mode, each successful
        packet transmission increases the sliding window by one, while each dropped packet cuts
        it in half. It seems many parameters were chosen because they were simple, not because
        they were the best.

        TCP ex Machina is a suggested TCP congestion control mechanism created in 2013 by Keith 
        Winstein and Hari Balakrishnan, from MIT, with the help of a neural net informed by a
        genetic algorithm. While their simulations found TCP ex Machina's network performance was
        better than current TCP congestion control, they only simulated performance in the case of 100%
        adoption. Since full adoption never happens immediately in real life, a mechanism that is only optimized
        for 100% adoption will not be adopted in the first place.

        We seek to address the gap in Winstein's and Balakrishnan's research by creating a different
        genetic algorithm that will seek to optimize performance at all adoption levels, creating a congestion
        control mechanism that is not only better in theory, but also more likely to be adopted in practice.
	
\section{Proposed Work}
% Replace Winstein and Balakrishnan with special citation command
	We propose to generate an improved TCP congestion control mechanism using a genetic algorithm similar to the approach outlined by Winstein and Balakrishnan, with the special requirement that the algorithm must perform well at low adoption rates for both adopters and non-adopters. We will define good performance by testing the mechanism on a simulated network, and measuring each end host's utility based on latency, throughput, and reliability; a good mechanism will score better on average at all or almost all adoption rates among both adopters and non-adopters.
	\subsection{Simulation Network}
		Any structured machine learning algorithm needs to be able to evaluate 
		the performance of an action, and to evaluate performance an agent 
		needs data. We propose to create a program that will simulate a wide-
		area network (WAN) with properties that resemble the Internet. The 
		program will use a directed graph to represent the simulation network,
		with nodes representing hosts and edges representing links. Some nodes
		will be end hosts which try to open TCP connections with one another 
		and transmit data, and other nodes will be routers which try to 
		faithfully carry the packets. All four types of network delay 
		(propagation delay, processing delay, transmission delay, and queuing 
		delay) will be represented, and both links and routers will introduce
		noise and corrupt packets. Where possible, the network topology and 
		delay/reliability properties will be as similar as possible to the 
		Internet. The simulation network will monitor and record network 
		performance data for later analysis.
	\subsection{Congestion Control Neural Net and Genetic Algorithm}
		In their paper, Winstein and Balakrishnan used a genetic algorithm to inform a neural network that affected the TCP congestion control properties, Their reasoning, as they say, was that ``the best way to approach this question is to take the design of specific algorithmic mechanisms out of the hands of human designers (no mater how sophisticated!), and make the end-to-end algorithm be a function of the desired overall behavior." We agree with their reasoning, and commend their eloquence.
			    
\section{Proposed Experiments}
	For each generation, we will measure the performance of each candidate algorithm in the simulated network at several different adoption rates. The total utility of the simulation will be a function of the total utility of each user, which is itself a function of that user's throughput, latency, and reliability characteristics. The fitness function our genetic algorithm uses will be based on total simulation utility at each adoption rate, with low adoption rates weighted more.
	\subsection{Expected Results}
		We are hesitant to speculate as to what congestion control mechanisms will perform best, but as Winstein and Balakrishnan found, we expect to find significant room for improvement over current TCP standards, even at low adoption rates. The mechanism that results from this may be too difficult to comprehend; this was the case for Winstein and Balakrishnan, and will most likely be the case for us. In the end, it is possible that no mechanism improves congestion control for all adoption levels, that one stricly dominates all possibilities, or several excel at different areas. If we cannot hope to comprehend the solution, the chances are slim that we could accurately predict them.
