\section{Abstract}
	TCP's constant parameters don't have any research backing them up. While
	better values for the constants have been found, they are not practical
	to implement. Our research aims to find optimize the TCP parameters in 
	such a way to maximize efficiency on systems that do not have full
	adoption while not harming those who don't adopt. We expect to find
	some values that may or may not be similar to the full adoption rate
	values that achieve overall better performance values than the current
	TCP parameters.
\section{Background and Introduction}
	Many of the constant parameters used in TCP seem arbirtrary and unfounded
	in good	scientific research. For instance, the additive increase constant 
	is one and the multiplicative deacrease is 1/2. These values were chosen 
	because they were simple and not because they were the best. In the 
	research "Deus ex TCP" by Winstein and Balakrishnan, they use genetic
	algorithms to find the optimal values for all TCP parameters. While the
	values they found worked better than current ones, they did not	explore
	the case where only	some routers adopted optimized parameters and others 
	did not. Unfortunately, the chances of their changes being adopted are
	slim, as old routers would no longer be guarateed to function optimally.
	
	
\section{Proposed Work}
% Replace Winstein and Balakrishnan with special citation command
	We propose to generate an improved TCP congestion control mechanism using a genetic algorithm similar to the approach outlined by Winstein and Balakrishnan, with the special requirement that the algorithm must perform well at low adoption rates for both adopters and non-adopters. We will define good performance by testing the mechanism on a simulated network, and measuring each end host's utility based on latency, throughput, and reliability; a good mechanism will score better on average at all or almost all adoption rates among both adopters and non-adopters.
	\subsection{Simulation Network}
		Any structured machine learning algorithm needs to be able to evaluate 
		the performance of an action, and to evaluate performance an agent 
		needs data. We propose to create a program that will simulate a wide-
		area network (WAN) with properties that resemble the Internet. The 
		program will use a directed graph to represent the simulation network,
		with nodes representing hosts and edges representing links. Some nodes
		will be end hosts which try to open TCP connections with one another 
		and transmit data, and other nodes will be routers which try to 
		faithfully carry the packets. All four types of network delay 
		(propagation delay, processing delay, transmission delay, and queuing 
		delay) will be represented, and both links and routers will introduce
		noise and corrupt packets. Where possible, the network topology and 
		delay/reliability properties will be as similar as possible to the 
		Internet. The simulation network will monitor and record network 
		performance data for later analysis.
	\subsection{Congestion Control Neural Net and Genetic Algorithm}
		In their paper, Winstein and Balakrishnan used a genetic algorithm to inform a neural network that affected the TCP congestion control properties, Their reasoning, as they say, was that "the best way to approach this question is to take the design of specific algorithmic mechanisms out of the hands of human designers (no mater how sophisticated!), and make the end-to-end algorithm be a function of the desired overall behavior." We agree with their reasoning, and commend their eloquence.
			    
\section{Proposed Experiments}
	We will run our genetic algorithms For each generation, we will measure the performance of each candidate algorithm in the simulated network at several different mechanism rates. The overall utility of the simulation will be a function of the utility of each user, which is itself a function of that user's throughput, latency, and reliability characteristics. Our genetic algorithm will use the fitness function based on total simulation utility at each adoption rate, with low adoption rates weighted more.
	\subsection{Expected Results}
		We are hesitant to speculate as to what congestion control mechanisms will perform best, but as Winstein and Balakrishnan found, we expect to find significant room for improvement over current TCP standards, even at low adoption rates. The mechanism that results from this may be too difficult to comprehend; this was the case for Winstein and Balakrishnan, and will most likely be the case for us. In the end, it is possible that no mechanism improves congestion control for all adoption levels, that one stricly dominates all possibilities, or several excel at different areas. If we cannot hope to comprehend the solution, the chances are slim that we could accurately predict them.
