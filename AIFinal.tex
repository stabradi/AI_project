% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Recent research has used Artificial Intelligence to identify alternative
congestion control mechanisms for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that
resulted in significant performance increase; however, the mechanisms in
question were only tested at full (100\%) adoption, leaving a
nigh-insurmountable barrier of entry for the revised protocol. Our research
seeks to find alternative mechanisms that improve performance on networks that
do not have full adoption, even for those who do not adopt. We expected to find
some alternative mechanisms that achieve better performance than the current
TCP congestion control mechanism at many or all adoption rates, but we were
unable to implement the simulation environment needed to train our algorithm.

\section{Introduction}
Many aspects of TCP's existing congestion control mechanism appear to have been
selected out of convenience rather than carefully chosen to maximize
performance. For instance, when in the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease
(AIMD) mode, each successful packet transmission increases the size of the TCP
sliding window by one, while each dropped packet cuts it in half. It seems many
parameters were chosen because they were simple, not because they were the best.
Our project endeavored to use an intelligent system to develop a more effective
congestion control mechanism. AIMD has been improved on, most recently in TCP
New Reno [2]; however, the congestion control mechanism has never been
designed by an artificial intelligence. A small amount of prior work has
explored this possibility [1], but the work on the problem has been limited and
largely theoretical. While our work is definitely still on the theoretical side,
it begins to look at the practical problem of adoption. We show a neural
network that can be trained to deal with mixed levels of adoption, with some
hosts running an existing congestion control mechanism, and some running an
algorithm specified by the neural network.

\subsection{TCP Congestion Control}
RFC 5681 specifies a congestion control mechanism for TCP called
additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) to avoid flooding networks with
more traffic than they can carry. Sending more data through a link than it is
able to handle causes packet loss, introducing significant amounts of waste
traffic which will consume resources without improving end to end data
throughput. The congestion control mechanism currently used in TCP is known as
the sliding window. The sliding window keeps track of the number of packets
sent-but-not-acknowledged, and only allows $n$ packets to be in this state. When
a packet is successfully acknowledged, $n$ is increased by one (additive
increase); conversely, when a packet is lost, requiring retransmission, $n$ is
halved (multiplicative decrease). AIMD produces a traffic profile called a
``sawtooth", in which the send rate is always approaching the current available
network capacity. This sawtooth produces a lot of waste, as everytime the
sawtooth dips, it's loosing efficiency.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Related Work}
Remy is a program, created in 2013 by Keith Winstein and Hari Balakrishnan at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that designs TCP congestion control
mechanisms called RemyCCs. Their simulations found that properly informed
RemyCCs performed far better than current TCP congestion control. The results
were impressive, but Winstein and Balakrishnan noted that they only simulated
performance in the case of full adoption of the RemyCC algorithm. Since full
adoption never happens immediately in real life, a mechanism that is only
optimized for full adoption will never be adopted in the first place.

We sought to address this gap in Winstein's and Balakrishnan's research by
creating a neural network that would seek to optimize performance at all
adoption levels, creating a protocol that is not only better in theory, but also
more likely to be adopted in practice.

Unfortunately, it is a relatively recent issue, and while some others have tackled the problem of impoving TCP, none have done it with AI. Winstein and Balakrishnan themselves had no references to similar works.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Our goal wass to improve network performance (as measured by throughput and
latency) as much as possible by eliminating unnecessary waste. A congestion
control mechanism seeks to satisfy have a few properties. First and foremost, it
must be fair. If the new congestion control algorithms on the network worsen
performance for non-adopters, then the algorithm is completely non-viable.
Secondly, the mechanism must actually improve network utilization compared to
the baseline (in our case, AIMD). Finally, the algorithm must have a somewhat
stable result. If from run to run the algorithm varies in performance wildly, 
the product may be practically unusable.

\section{Methodology}
% Replace Winstein and Balakrishnan with special citation command
We attempted to generate an improved TCP congestion control mechanism using a
neural network similar to the approach outlined by Winstein and Balakrishnan,
with the special requirement that the algorithm must perform well \textit{at low
adoption rates} for both adopters and non-adopters. 
\subsection{Simulation Network}
Any structured machine learning algorithm needs to be able to evaluate 
the performance results of an action, and to evaluate performance an agent 
needs data. We created a program to simulate a dumbell-shaped network 
with properties that resemble the network topology of a street's cable network
(the local cable uplink is usually the bottleneck for a typical home internet
user). The simulation network can be seen as a directed graph,
with nodes representing hosts and edges representing links. Five nodes are
local end hosts which try to open TCP connections and send data to remote hosts
on the other side of the bottleneck link, five remote hosts which accept and
respond to the messages sent by the local nodes, and an overloaded bottleneck
link with a drop-tail queue eviction strategy. When the simulation begins
running, each sender node attempts to send $m$ packets, where $m$ is an
arbitrary but consistent number. Once those packets are sent, the simulation
ends. Our grading criteria for how well our network did depends on how many
packets had to be retransmitted, and how many 'ticks' (single unit of time in
the simulator) it ran for. The fewer packets had to be retransmitted and the
fewer ticks it took, the better the mechanism performed.  

The network topology we chose was the dumbell topology. We chose this because
it matches the layout of an internet service provider's street gateway, with one
router trying to queue packets for dozens of houses on its subnet. Our
network consists of a series of end hosts that send data over a router, which
then passes the data on to recievers. The recievers simply track and acknowledge
received packets. The simulation network monitors and records network
performance data for later analysis.

\subsection{Training the Neural Net}
Winstein and Balakrishnan's reasoning for using artificial intelligence was, as
they say, was that ``the best way to approach this question [of congestion
control] is to take the design of specific algorithmic mechanisms out of the
hands of human designers (no matter how sophisticated!), and make the end-to-end
algorithm be a function of the desired overall behavior." We agree with their
reasoning, and commend their eloquence. We will use their mindset to generate
our own research, which will expand on their work, generalizing their approach
to cases where only partial adoption of our mechanism exists, though ours will
have to account for varying degrees of adoption. This way, end hosts that use
our mechanism can exist in harmony with those that do not. There are three
inputs to the neural net: an exponentially weighted moving average of the
time between packet sends, an exponentially weighted moving average of the time
between received acknowlegements, and the ratio of round-trip time (the time it
takes for a packet to reach its destination and get acknowledged) to the minmum
observed round-trip time for that link. These three inputs form an observable
state our net can act on.

We used backpropogation to train our neural net. The plan was to
simulation with a randomly seeded neural net, then train it to convergence
offline. Our utility function has three variables. $\alpha$
rewards the algorithm for each sucessfully acknowledged package, while $\beta$
punishes it for every dropped package. $\gamma$ punishes each packet that causes
another packet to be dropped. When a new packet arrives at a link and is dropped
from the queue, every packet waiting in that queue is penalized for causing
congestion. Tuning these constants is a matter of trial and error.

\section{Results}
We changed our simulation technique at the last minute, and implemented a
homemade network simulator. The lack of a working simulator made it impossible
to test the algorithm.

% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.

\section{Results}
Unfortunately, we were unable to test our algorithm as our network simulator never worked. We spent a lot of time attempting to get Network Simulator 2 (NS) to work. Right before it appeared to work, it was revealed that the behavior we desired was unreasonably difficult to implement. In order to circumvent these difficulties, we have attempted to create our own network simulator, specially tailored to our problem. We did not realize how difficult this would be, and doing it last minute was probably a bad idea. In retrospect, we should have left NS sooner, since the lost time we could have used developing our simulator. We speculate that we lost almost thirty manhours on NS. Our simulator is currently sending packets without us ever creating them, and is also acknowledging packets that don't exist. We cannot do a reasonable study under these conditions, and must move on. We anticipate that the project is still worthwhile to pusue and may revisit it at a later date.


\section{Conclusion}
It is extremely disheartening to put a decent amount of work in an AI, get it more or less working, then having the testbed fail horrifically. The testbed turned out to be a monumentous task, and one that we reasonably could only finish if we hadn't sunk so much time into NS.
