% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
Recent research has used Artificial Intelligence to identify alternative congestion control
mechanisms for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that resulted in significant performance increase;
however, the mechanisms in question were only tested at full (100\%)
adoption, leaving a nigh-insurmountable barrier of entry for the revised protocol. Our research seeks to find alternative mechanisms that improve performance on networks that do not have full adoption, even for those who do not adopt. We expect to find
some alternative mechanisms that achieve better performance than the current
TCP congestion control mechanism at many or all adoption rates.

\section{Introduction}
Many aspects of TCP's existing congestion control mechanism appear to have
been selected out of convenience rather than carefully chosen to maximize performance.
For instance, when in the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) mode, each successful packet transmission increases the size of the TCP sliding window by one, while each dropped packet cuts it in half. It seems many parameters were chosen because they were simple, not because they were the best. Our project endeavored to use an intelligent system to develop a more effective congestion control mechanism. AIMD has been improved on, most recently in TCP New Reno [REF]; however, never has the congestion control mechanism been designed by an artificial intelligence. A small amount of prior work has explored this [WB], but the work on the problem has been limited and largely theoretical. While our work is definitely still on the theoretical side, it attempts to solve the practical problem of adoption. We show that a neural net can be trained to deal with mixed levels of adoption. We ran simulations where some of our end hosts use the AIMD protocol while others use a protocol defined by a neural net.

\subsection{TCP Congestion Control}
RFC 5681 specifies a congestion control mechanism for TCP called additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) to avoid flooding networks with more traffic than they can carry. Sending more data through a link than it is able to handle causes packet loss, introducing significant amounts of waste traffic which will consume resources without improving end to end data throughput. The congestion control mechanism currently used in TCP is known as the sliding window. The sliding window keeps track of the number of packets sent-but-not-acknowledged, and only allows $n$ packets to be in this state. When a packet is successfully acknowledged, $n$ is increased by one (additive increase); conversely, when a packet is lost, requiring retransmission, $n$ is halved (multiplicative decrease). AIMD produces a traffic profile called a ``sawtooth", in which the send rate is always approaching the current available network capacity. This sawtooth produces a lot of waste, as everytime the sawtooth dips, it's loosing efficiency.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Related Work}
TCP ex Machina is a suggested TCP congestion control mechanism created in 2013 by Keith 
Winstein and Hari Balakrishnan, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the help of a neural net informed by a
genetic algorithm. While their simulations found TCP ex Machina's network performance was
better than current TCP congestion control. Their results were rather impressive, but they noted that they only simulated performance in the case of full
adoption. Since full adoption never happens immediately in real life, a mechanism that is only optimized for full adoption will not be adopted in the first place.


We seek to address the gap in Winstein's and Balakrishnan's research by creating a different
genetic algorithm that will seek to optimize performance at all adoption levels, creating a protocol that is not only better in theory, but also more likely to be adopted in practice.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Our goal is to eliminate as much unnecessary waste of network utilization. As part of the goal, the mechanism must have a few properties. First and foremost, it must be fair. If the machines on the system worsen performance for non-adopters, then the algorithm is considered completely non-viable. Secondly, the mechanism must actually improve network utilization compared to the baseline, in our case, AIMD. Finally, our algorithm must have a somewhat stable result. If from run to run the algorithm varies in performance wildly, the product may be practically unusable.

\section{Methodology}
% Replace Winstein and Balakrishnan with special citation command
We attempted to generate an improved TCP congestion control mechanism using a genetic algorithm similar to the approach outlined by Winstein and Balakrishnan, with the special requirement that the algorithm must perform well \textit{at low adoption rates} for both adopters and non-adopters. 
\subsection{Simulation Network}
Any structured machine learning algorithm needs to be able to evaluate 
the performance results of an action, and to evaluate performance an agent 
needs data. We created a program that will simulate a wide-area 
network (WAN) with properties that resemble the Internet. The 
program will uses a directed graph to represent the simulation network,
with nodes representing hosts and edges representing links. Some nodes
will be end hosts which try to open TCP connections with one another 
and transmit data, and other nodes will be routers which try to 
faithfully carry packets. When the simulation begins running,
each sender node attempts to send $m$ packets, where $m$ is an arbitrary
but consistent number. Once those packets are sent, the simulation ends. Our
grading criteria for how well our network did depends on how many packets had
to be retransmitted and how many 'ticks' (single unit of time in the simulator) it ran for.
The less packets that had to be retransmitted and the less ticks it took, the better the
mechanism performed.  
The network topology we chose was the dumbell topology. We chose this because
it is the same topology the Internet uses.
similar enough to the Internet. Our network consists of a series of end
hosts that send data over a router, which then passes the data on to recievers.
The recievers can then The simulation network will monitor and record network 
performance data for later analysis.

\subsection{Training the Neural Net}
On page 2 of their paper, Winstein and Balakrishnan introduced a genetic algorithm to inform a neural network that affected TCP ex Machina's congestion control properties. Their reasoning, as they say, was that ``the best way to approach this question is to take the design of specific algorithmic mechanisms out of the hands of human designers (no matter how sophisticated!), and make the end-to-end algorithm be a function of the desired overall behavior." We agree with their reasoning, and commend their eloquence. We will use their methods and mindset to generate our own research, which will expand on their work, generalizing their solution to cases where only partial adoption of our mechanism exists, though ours will have to account for varying degrees of adoption. This way, end hosts that use our mechanism can exist in harmony with those that do not. Also we used backpropogation to train our neural net, as opposed to using a genetic algorithm. We shall run a network simulation with a randomly seeded neural net, then train it to convergence offline. There are three inputs to our neural net. An exponentially weighted moving average of the.Our utility function has three variables, alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha rewards the algorithm for each sucessfully acknowledged package, while beta punishes it for every dropped package. Gamma punishes each packet every time a different packet gets dropped while the original packet waits in a queue. Each packet in a full queue when a new packet attempts to arrive and is blocked is punished because it was partially responsible for the congestion.
