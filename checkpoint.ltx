\section{Summary of Goals}
	Our project seeks to use an intelligent system to develop a more effective congestion control mechanism for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In order to do this, we propose to utilize a neural net. The neural net will make a decision on whether or not to send each packet in the send queue, then we will use a utility function (defined in Progress section) to decide whether or not we should have send the packet. The final goal of this project is create an end host capable of near-optimally choosing whether or not to send a packet.
We are using the Python-Based Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Library (PyBrain) in order to handle the storage and training of the neural net. We utilize a tool that will simulate a wide-area network (WAN) with properties that resemble the Internet, Network Simulator (NS), which is the status quo for research of this type 


\section{Progress To Date}
At this point in time, we have a set up a neural net with PyBrain with three inputs and n outputs, where n is the max size of the send queue of the sender. The three inputs are the same as in [reference] and the outputs are a binary decision on whether or not it should have sent the packet at that point in the queue. We have implemented an algorithm that (for each connection) uses round trip time (RTT) over the minimum observed RTT to judge whether or not a packet should have been sent. We use this judgement as training data for the neural net.

\section{Revised Project Plan}
Originally, the project proposed to find the right mechanism to optimize a network with a genetic algorithm informing the neural net. We have found this to be impractical and found that by using a few qualifiers, we can achieve much better results at a fraction of the cost.
