\section{Summary of Goals}
	Our project seeks to use an intelligent system to develop a more effective congestion control mechanism for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In order to do this, we propose to utilize a neural net. The neural net will make a decision on whether or not to send each packet in the send queue, then we will use a utility function (defined in Progress section) to decide whether or not we should have send the packet. The final goal of this project is create an end host capable of near-optimally choosing whether or not to send a packet, improving network throughput and latency. Our utility function will reward both low latency and high throughput. 
We are using the Python-Based Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Library (PyBrain) in order to handle the storage and training of the neural net. We utilize a tool that will simulate a wide-area network (WAN) with properties that resemble the Internet, Network Simulator (NS), which is the status quo for research of this type.


\section{Progress To Date}
At this point in time, we have a set up a neural net with PyBrain with three inputs and n outputs, where n is the max size of the send queue of the end host. The three inputs are the same as Winstein and Balakrishnan's flow control. The first variable is an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of the time between acknowledgements, the send is a EWMA of the time between TCP sender time stamps in those ackowledgements, and the thirdd is the ratio of most recent rout trip time (RTT) over the minimum observed RTT. Using these three characterists, our net judgse whether or not a packet should have been sent. We use this judgement as training data for the neural net. Our utility function rewards sucessfully acknowledged packets and punsihes dropped ones.

\section{Revised Project Plan}
Originally, the project proposed to find the right mechanism to optimize a network with a genetic algorithm informing the neural net. After reviewing the prior work in more detail, we have discovered that the training took cpu-months to finish. We shall both simplify our algorithm to achieve some result at a fraction of the cost. As was our original intention, we plan to test the with partial adoption rates and see if we can improve latency and throughput for all network users.
