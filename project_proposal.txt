	We propose to generate an improved TCP congestion control mechanism using a genetic algorithm similar to the approach outlined by Winstein and Balakrishnan, with the special requirement that the algorithm must perform well at low adoption rates for both adopters and non-adopters. We will define good performance by testing the mechanism on a simulated network, and measuring each end host's utility based on latency, throughput, and reliability; a good mechanism will score better on average at all or almost all adoption rates among both adopters and non-adopters.
	\subsection{Simulation Network}
		Any structured machine learning algorithm needs to be able to evaluate the performance of an action, and to evaluate performance an agent needs data. We propose to create a program that will simulate a wide-area network (WAN) with properties that resemble the Internet. The program will use a directed graph to represent the simulation network, with nodes representing hosts and edges representing links. Some nodes will be end hosts which try to open TCP connections with one another and transmit data, and other nodes will be routers which try to faithfully carry the packets. All four types of network delay (propagation delay, processing delay, transmission delay, and queuing delay) will be represented, and both links and routers will introduce noise and corrupt packets. Where possible, the network topology and delay/reliability properties will be as similar as possible to the Internet. The simulation network will monitor and record network performance data for later analysis.
	\subsection{Congestion Control Neural Net and Genetic Algorithm}
		In their paper, Winstein and Balakrishnan used a genetic algorithm to inform a neural network that affected the TCP congestion control properties, Their reasoning, as they say, was that "the best way to approach this question is to take the design of specific algorithmic mechanisms out of the hands of human designers (no mater how sophisticated!), and make the end-to-end algorithm be a function of the desired overall behavior." We agree with their reasoning, and commend their eloquence.
